 # With features such as



* Real-Time Communication - Using Socket.io to check who is currently in the chatroom and append a new text message to everyone's page when it is sent
* Message history - Using Postgresql to store messages unique to each chatroom so the user isn’t confused when their previous messages aren’t there
* ChatGPT Integration - Using ChatGPT’s 3.5 turbo model, we have prompted the language model to act as if it were an instructor at our school in every chatroom, giving the user and those connected in the chat room the ability to access chatGPT without leaving the site
